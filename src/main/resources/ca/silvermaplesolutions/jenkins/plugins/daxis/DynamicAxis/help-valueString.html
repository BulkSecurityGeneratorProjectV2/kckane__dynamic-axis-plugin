<div>
  The name of the environment variable to extract the values from (e.g., 
  MY_AXIS_LIST). Do not include qualifiers or variable access characters such 
  as $ or ${}. At runtime the contents of this variable will be expanded to 
  provide the axis values for this matrix build. 
  <P>
  An environment variable can be a Parameter, a Build Node variable, a 
  globally-defined variable or a value from the operating system environment. 
  Only the latter can actually be validated here because the rest are assigned 
  at actual build time. If the specified variable cannot be found at build time 
  the axis list will contain a single value of "default".
  <P>
  The rules for the value of this variable are the same as for the standard
  <em>User-defined Axis</em> option: one or more values separated with a 
  space (e.g., "dev tst sit", without the quotes).
  <P>
  Note that variable names are case-sensitive on some platforms. Also, names 
  containing certain characters (such as periods) may be valid on one system 
  but not another. For portability reasons it is recommended to specify names 
  containing only alphanumeric and underscore characters only.
